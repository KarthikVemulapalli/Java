Algorithm: An algorithm describes steps to perform a specific task. For a given task there can be multiple algorithms.

Big O Notation: Basically how many steps it takes to complete the execution of code.
    1. Time Complexity
        Constant        - O(1)
        Linear          - O(n)
        Logarithmic     - O(logn base 2)
        n log-star n    - O(nlogn base 2)
        Quadratic       - O(n^2)
    2. Memory Complexity

    * Best approach to get time complexity is,
        constant > Logarithmic > Linear > n log-star n > Quadratic
